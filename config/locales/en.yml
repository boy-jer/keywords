    instruction1: "This app will help you find Twitter users who are talking about certain things. These users will be listed according to the relevancy of what they're saying and to what you consider important."
    instruction2: "The mechanism is simple, you input some keywords and define their priority between basic, low and high. We then search Twitter for tweets containing those keywords and return the most relevant users that happen to mention said keywords."
    instruction3: "To begin, input some keywords by typing them and pressing Return(Enter). Feel free to rearrange them between priorities as you like, and when you're done, click 'Search'."

    basic_info: "The core keywords of your search. This is where you should input most of your keywords as these will be responsible for most of the results. Recommended maximum keyword number: 10-15."
    low_info: "Least important keywords. These should be more general terms that would yield very inaccurate results by themselves, but, when combined with results coming from the basic or high keywords, would become more relevant. Recommended maximum keyword number: 5-10."
    high_info: "Most important keywords. Any user who tweets one of these keywords will most likely appear in the results regardless of other keywords, so be very careful when choosing these. Recommended maximum keyword number: 0-3."
